               investigate if the graduates of the BEEd program of Bataan
               Peninsula State University Dinalupihan Campus have met the
               expectations provided in CMO No. 74 series of 2017. This study
               uses an explanatory-sequential design which is a two-phase
               approach, where quantitative results of the study, from
               collected quantitative data using a survey questionnaire in
               phase 1 were followed up and supported by qualitative data
               collected in phase 2 to further explain the findings. The
               results of the study indicate that significant difference is
               evident in the competency of the respondents based on the
               expected competencies as stated at CMO No. 74, series of 2017 in
               terms of in-depth understanding of learners; pedagogical content
               knowledge; assessment and evaluation; communication, higher
               order thinking, and technology; attributes of model teacher;
               personal and professional development; when respondents have
               grouped accordingly, as provided by the p-values which are
               statistically lesser than the alpha of .05. In general,
               graduates confidently believes that they possess the
               competencies stated and describe in CMO No. 74 s. 2017, their
               Cooperating Teachers and Coordinators, however, based on their
               qualitative responses, pointed out that there are still areas of
               competencies that are needed to be developed among the
               graduates. The result of the study indicates that the
               institution should revisit the program implementation of CMO No.

              complex. Diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance is present in
              more than 2/3rd of pancreatic cancer patients. Epidemiological
              studies have consistently shown a modest increase in the risk of
              pancreatic cancer in type 2 diabetes, with an inverse
              relationship to duration of disease. Additionally, recent studies
              suggest that anti-diabetic medications may modulate the risk of
              pancreatic cancer in type 2 diabetes. Subjects >50 years of age
              with new onset diabetes are at higher risk of having pancreatic
              cancer. However, to screen new-onset diabetes for pancreatic
              cancer, additional markers are needed that can distinguish
              pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes from type 2 diabetes.",
